To start the conky type ALT+F2 and then "conky -d -c *path*/conkylogo". You have to extract the folder in the archive somewhere and replace *path* with the real path.

Before starting the conky you have to change the path of the lua configuration file in conkylogo:

# -- Lua Load -- #
lua_load *path*/ringslogo.lua

Under the TEXT area you have to change the paths of the two images (ubuntu.png and ubuntured.png).
Then in the ringslogo.lua file you have to change the path of conkyBanshee.py.

Once you've done these passages, if you want conky to display the current status of a music player which is not banshee, you have to modify the ringslogo.lua file. Search these two lines:

name='execi ',
arg='2 *path*/conkyBanshee.py --datatype=PP --nounknownoutput',

And replace "conkyBanshee.py" with "conkyRhythmbox.py", or another music player supported by Conky Hardcore (see "https://launchpad.net/~conkyhardcore/+archive/ppa/+packages").
